Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation (RAG) System

Objective:
The primary objective of this assignment is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines document retrieval with a generative model to answer questions. The assignment involves implementing a document retrieval system using TF-IDF, followed by answer generation using a pre-trained language model, such as BART or T5.

Applications: 
1. Customer Support Systems (Chatbots)
2. Medical Diagnosis and Healthcare
3. Education and E-Learning Platforms
4. Search Engines and Information Retrieval
5. Business Intelligence and Analytics
   
Features
1. Document retrieval using TF-IDF.
2. Answer generation using T5-small.
3. Evaluation metrics: Exact Match and F1 Score.

Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the scripts as described in the usage section.
