Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation-RAG-System

The primary objective of this assignment is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines document retrieval with a generative model to answer questions. The assignment involves implementing a document retrieval system using TF-IDF, followed by answer generation using a pre-trained language model, such as BART or T5.
