Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation (RAG) System

Problem Description:
The problem addressed by this project is the need for an efficient and accurate question-answering system that can provide relevant answers based on a given context, leveraging both document retrieval and natural language generation techniques.This project aims to overcome these limitations by integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The system retrieves the most relevant document from a predefined corpus based on the question, then generates an answer using a pre-trained language model like T5. The goal is to provide answers that are contextually accurate and natural, even when the input question is phrased differently from the content in the document.

Objective:
The primary objective of this assignment is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines document retrieval with a generative model to answer questions. The assignment involves implementing a document retrieval system using TF-IDF, followed by answer generation using a pre-trained language model, such as BART or T5.
